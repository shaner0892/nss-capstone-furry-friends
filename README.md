# Nashville Furry Friends

Nashville Furry Friends is my front-end capstone project for Nashville Software School. It was created to help local foster dogs get adopted. This app streamlines the process and allows users to post about their foster dog directly rather than sending it to the rescue. Potential adopters are able to login and see all dogs from different rescues rather than visiting multiple sites. They can see upcoming events and blog posts about adoptable and alumni dogs.

## Technologies Used

This application uses JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Reactstrap. The data presented is served via json-server.
